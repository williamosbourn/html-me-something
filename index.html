            <h2>Why not think of a new and fun way</h2>
              <img src="./images/paradise.jpg" alt="dishes and paradise">
                <p>
                    People have been washing dishes the same way for too long. You have some dirty dishes, you get some water, and then some soap, 
                    and then scrub them, rinse them and then you dry them. In the twentieth century, the dish washer was invented. With this new contraption,
                    you simply put them in there, add soap, and turn it on. People thought that was easy. But guess what, after a decade or two, people became
                    complacent and even more lazy. No one wants to open that heavy dishwasher door, and neatly stack the dirty dishes in a box. What a hassle!
                    Am I right? I mean wouldn't be easier if after doing the dishes you were wisked away to a beach in the caribbean with the sunshining while
                    drinking a delicious cocktail. I think most people would agree. Screw doing the dishes or even putting them in the dishwasher. Let's go to the beach.

            <h2>The secrets to my success</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome back to the real world. Too bad you can't be whisked away to a luxurious beach, far far away from those
                    pesky dishes. You have to eat, and those dishes ain't gonna wash themselves. They'll just sit there, 
                    stacked up in the sink forever. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've discovered a new way to wash the dishes using current technology and a little innovation. Follow these easy steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grab all those dirty dishes and stack them up in the bathtub.</li>
                        <li>Grab your favorite dish soap, and pour it over the dishes. I prefer grease fighting Dawn.</li>
                        <li>Fill the bathtub with warm water. Imagine the water to be the same temperature of the waters of Cancun way down in Mexico.</li>
                        <li>Grab some candles, put them along the bathtub, and light them. If you have a dimmer on the lights, dim the lights to low.</li>
                        <li>Now, take off all your clothes. Or get in your bathing suit. You can also just get into the water with your clothes on. Really, there's no wrong way to do this.</li>
                        <li>Get in the bathtub with the dirty dishes. You will feel sexy, confident, and in a strange way excited to wash those dishes. Just follow your heart.</li>
                        <li>Take your time, wash each dish carefully. Put them aside to dry.</li>                    
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After you're done, sit back and relax. It'll be just like you're in paradise. You will feel relieved, relaxed, and content
                    that you finished the dishes. If possible, make a delicious cocktail, my favorite is a mojito. This revolutionary way of
                    washing dishes is called <strong>DishTubbing</strong>. It had been heralded as the biggest innovation and discovery 
                    since Einstein's E=MC&#178.

            <h2>Beware: DishTubbing Discrimination</h2>

                <p>
                    Be careful, revolutionary ideas have a way of creating discord among the masses even hate. People don't like change especially
                    things they can't understand. Some cities and even some states are in the process of passing laws banning <strong>DishTubbing</strong>. 
                    But the truth shall set you free. Progress can't chained down. Embrace <em>DishTubbing</em>, it will change your life.
